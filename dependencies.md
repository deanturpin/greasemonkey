# Greasemonkey versus Tampermonkey

These scripts are used by a JavaScript injection plugin. I've used
Greasemonkey in Firefox and Tampermonkey with Chrome. They're the same sort of
thing but I prefer the Chrome/TM combination. The editor's less quirky, has good
error highlighting and I like how it keeps everything in tabs. The main
Greasemonkey annoyance for me is saving: you can happily save your work to
another location but the editor is then editing the saved location, not the live
version in the browser. Also the pretty print button has some extreme results!

# Workflow

I'm really pleased with this workflow: snapping the page we're updating to one
side and the Tampermonkey editor to the other. I'm running Ubuntu Gnome.
