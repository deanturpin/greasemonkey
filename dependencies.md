# Greasemonkey versus Tampermonkey

These scripts are used by a a JavaScript injection plugin. I've used
Greasemonkey in Firefox and Tampermonkey with Chrome. They're the same sort of
thing but I prefer the Chrome/TM combination. The editor's less quirky, has good
error highlighting and I like how it keeps everything in tabs.
