Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary, Over many a quaint
and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly
there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door - Only this, and
nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying
ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I
had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost
Lenore - For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore - Nameless
here for evermore.
