# Greasemonkey versus Tampermonkey

Style Counsel uses a JavaScript injection plugin. I've used Greasemonkey in
Firefox and Tampermonkey with Chrome. They're essentially the same sort of thing
but I prefer the Chrome/TM combination. The editor's less quirky, has good error
highlighting and I like how it keeps everything in tabs.
